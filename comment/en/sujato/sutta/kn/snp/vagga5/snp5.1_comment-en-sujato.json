  "snp5.1:1.3": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Ākiñcaññaṁ</i> could mean either “owning nothing” (per commentary, followed by Norman) or the “dimension of nothingness” (suggested by Bodhi). Given that just a little below we hear of him performing an expensive sacrifice; and further, that the dimension of nothingness is an important part of the conversation with of his students Upasīva and Posāla, the latter seems more likely. Anyway, “aspiring to own nothing” is hardly a noteworthy trait among ascetics. ",

  "snp5.1:15.2": "Note that, in the EBTs, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pathavimaṇḍala</i> primarily refers to the region ruled by a Wheel-Turning Monarch. Thus it doesn’t mean “circle” in the sense of “the circle of the earth” but rather a “sphere of influence”, i.e. “territory”. ",
  "snp5.1:16.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Purā</i> can be either “from the city” (Norman), or “formerly” (commentary, followed by Bodhi and Jayawickrama). I think the poet is deliberately echoing the opening line of the text, where it must mean “from the city”. ",
  "snp5.1:21.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Mandira</i> is unusual and probably a sign of lateness. Bodhi has “realm”, Norman “city”, but the normal meaning in Sanskrit is a “dwelling place”, and in the Jātakas it is always used in the sense of a home. ",
