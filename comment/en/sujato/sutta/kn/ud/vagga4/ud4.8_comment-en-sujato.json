  "ud4.8:2.2": "Anandajoti has “venture”, Thanissaro has “dare”, but a similar phrase at pli-tv-kd8:12.1.5 clearly has the weaker sense of “able”, per Ireland and commentary (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ussahasīti sakkosi</i>). ",
  "ud4.8:2.4": "Accepting the variant <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kiṁ mayā sakkā</i>, which is found in all similar passages. Reading, as Thanissaro and Anandajoti do, “what can I <em>not</em> do” is pleasingly dramatic, but not very idiomatic for Pali. Far more likely a simple reinforcement is meant. Commentary ignores this phrase, implying it thought there was nothing unusual. ",
  "ud4.8:6.3": "The idiom <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ime hi nāma</i> appears mildly emphatic in a disparaging way. Compare <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kathaṁ hi nāma</i> just below. "
