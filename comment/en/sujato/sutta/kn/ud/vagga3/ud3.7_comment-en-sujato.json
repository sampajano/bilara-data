  "ud3.7:3.6": "I’m not sure if <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anekarasabyañjano</i> is correct, although the word does occur at pv13:15.4 and pv27:12.4. The commentary, while not definitive, suggests <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anekasūpabyañjano</i> (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>anekehi sūpehi ceva byañjanehi ca</i>), which would be more idiomatic. However it is not attested. "
